/* Write a program that takes the name of a chess piece and returns the moves it makes.
As a challenge, make the program work both if it receives the name of a chess piece with capital letters and with small letters, without increasing the amount of conditional.
As a hint, you can search for a function that makes a string case (lower case).
If the past part is invalid, the program must return an error message.
Example: bishop -> diagonals
